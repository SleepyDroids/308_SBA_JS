# SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals ðŸ’¾

This program reads course data, assignments, and learner submissions, then produces a summary of learner data that calculates their GPA, grades per assignment and then collates their data according to their student ID, their current GPA based on submitted assignments and then their average per grade. 

Essentially a "file" per learner containing their GPAs. 

# Requirements Achieved âœ…

- Omitted an assignment if it wasn't due yet. 
- Utilized two different loop types (for and while).
- Used a try/catch statement to manage a potential error in the code.
- Used operators to perform calculations on variables and literals. 
- Declared variables properly using let and const where appropriate. (arrays and objects with const, mutable variables with let). 
- Used strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables. (ie. calculating averages). 
- Used at least two if/else statements to control program flow. (a lot of my logic was if statements).
- Created and/or manipulated arrays and objects.
- Demonstrated the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object. 
- Program outputs processed data as described above. (as close as I could get it to).
- Ensured that the program runs without errors.
- Created a function to account for the course ID not matching an assignment ID. 

# Reflection ðŸ’­

- I leaned very heavily on if else statements to supply most of my logic and to proc the program to build or manipulate arrays/objects. I acknowledge this isn't necessarily dynamic and I struggled on where I could add a function or what would qualify as a repeated task. 
- My main objective was to get to the output of return results as supplied in the example data, as closely as possible. 
- I think in the future, mapping out some sort of logic flow/tree and making sure the logic made sense to me will help, especially since I started diving in on the coding before fully establishing how I was going to access information and which information from the objects were the most relevant to the outputs I needed to match in the end. Also generally improving repetition with things like functions, different loop types and learning how to map objects as well: are all things that could improve the functionality of this program.
- Also providing more code for edge cases, increasing the program's overall scalability when it comes to future learners and accounting for additional assignments and their respective submissions.
